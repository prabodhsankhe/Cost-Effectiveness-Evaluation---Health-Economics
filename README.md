INTRODUCTION
The Indian Diabetes Prevention Programme (IDPP) conducted a three-year study to investigate strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes among individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A later Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) compared four intervention strategies: lifestyle modification (LSM) alone, metformin medication alone, LSM combined with metformin, and a control group receiving standard healthcare advice. The primary objective was to estimate intervention costs and assess cost-effectiveness relative to the control group.

METHODS
We recalculated Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) using a systematic method outlined by Glick et al., organizing interventions based on effectiveness and eliminating dominated therapies. We utilized clinical and cost parameters to compute ICERs and employed a Cost-Effectiveness (CE) plane to visually represent cost-effectiveness relationships. Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) assessed decision uncertainty, incorporating variability into model inputs through Monte Carlo simulations. Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) and Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves/Frontiers (CEAC/CEAF) provided insights into intervention cost-effectiveness across different thresholds of Willingness to Pay (WTP). Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and Net Loss Curves (NLC) analyzed the value of reducing uncertainty and the impact of selecting non-cost-effective treatments.

RESULTS
Revised ICER calculations identified LSM as the most cost-effective intervention for preventing diabetes among individuals with IGT, if WTP exceeded $565.15. Probabilistic analysis and CEAC/CEAF corroborated LSM's cost-effectiveness, showing it to be the preferred option at WTP thresholds above $550. LSM demonstrated the highest probability of being cost-effective until $3 million WTP. EVPI analysis suggested further research to reduce decision uncertainty.

DISCUSSION
Our findings contradict the original paper's conclusion, highlighting the importance of robust cost-effectiveness analysis methodologies. The variability in results underscores the need for additional research to inform accurate decision-making regarding diabetes prevention strategies.

CONCLUSION
While the original CEA suggested LSM followed by metformin as cost-effective, our analysis determined LSM as the preferred option if WTP exceeds $565.15. Our model highlights the necessity for rigorous analysis to guide informed decision-making in healthcare resource allocation. Further research is warranted to address uncertainties and refine cost-effectiveness evaluations.
